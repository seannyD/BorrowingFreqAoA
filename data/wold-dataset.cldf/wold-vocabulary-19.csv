On the one hand, the Turkic word for ‘dig’ is *qaːs, which developed into Sakha χas ‘to dig’. On the other hand, χoruy ‘scrape, dig’ was possibly copied from Mongolic (cf. χorut ‘to plough’). There is a verbalizing suffix -ɨy which mainly derives verbs from nouns and adjectives, though rarely from other word classes, too (Grammatika Sovremennogo Jakutskogo Literaturnogo Jazyka 1982: 219). One might therefore propose a reinterpretation of χoruy ‘scrape, dig’ as being derived from χor plus -uy, leading to the development of the verb χor ‘dig.ditch’. On the other hand, the Chuvash reflex of Proto-Turkic *aː is generally u (Ščerbak 1970: 157), and Proto-Turkic *s developed into r. An early Chuvash copy can therefore not be excluded; however, it should be noted that the modern Chuvash form for ‘scrape’ is xir, not xur or xor.",,,,χor-uː [dig.ditch-NMLZ],,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the fact that Orok (a Tungusic language not very closely related to Evenki and Even, and not in immediate contact with Sakha) also has this word, might be further support of Kałużyński’s theory. However, the word may have been copied into Orok from Evenki, which copied it from Sakha. This supposition is supported by the fact that all the Tungusic forms are practically identical, making a recent diffusion likely. Furthermore, other Turkic languages have words with an element ak- to mean ‘stupid’ (Öztopçu et al. 1996: 145), which might imply that this was not copied in Sakha after all. The element -aːrɨ in the Sakha form is identical to the purposive converb, suggesting that if this is an innovated form in Sakha it was derived from a Turkic verb which later got lost.",Kałużyński 1995 [1982]: 225,,,Present in pre-contact environment,

The verb xay from which we derive χayɨhar is analyzed by Slepcov as a homonym of xay(1) ‘to cover with something’; it seems to be used only with the object suolun ‘path/way.ACC’, i.e. suolun xay(2) ‘walk along tracks’ (Slepcov 1972: 473).
