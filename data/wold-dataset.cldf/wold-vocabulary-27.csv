The basic meaning of waja in Old Javanese is ‘tooth’, and by extension ‘metal tip (of a weapon)’; the meaning ‘steel’ seems to derive from the latter.  However, the basic meaning of the Malay cognate baja is ‘to temper’, and indeed Malay baja ‘steel’ seems to have developed by ellipsis from besi baja ‘tempered iron’.  Literary Malay bejana ‘vessel’ is from Sanskrit bhājana, whence Hindi-Urdu bhājan derives.

The meaning of bāzū  is ‘The arm, or the upper part of it; the cloth wrapped round the middle whilst bathing’.  The semantic connection to ‘shirt, clothing’ is tenuous.  Cognates of baju occur in Sundanese and in Javanese (including Old Javanese, where Persian influence is negligible or nonexistant).  There is also a cognate in Kualan, a language of Borneo, in the form bojuh (with the same meaning).  The vowel of the first syllable, as well as the final -h, both argue against it being a loanword, and for it being a retention.  Therefore I conclude that baju is most probably not a loanword.",,,,,,,,,,,,Sugiarto et al. 1995:25; Steingass 1892:145; Hayyim 1934-36:206,General,,,

The meaning of bāzū  is ‘The arm, or the upper part of it; the cloth wrapped round the middle whilst bathing’.  The semantic connection to ‘shirt, clothing’ is tenuous.  Cognates of baju occur in Sundanese and in Javanese (including Old Javanese, where Persian influence is negligible or nonexistant).  There is also a cognate in Kualan, a language of Borneo, in the form bojuh (with the same meaning).  The vowel of the first syllable, as well as the final -h, both argue against it being a loanword, and for it being a retention.  Therefore I conclude that baju is most probably not a loanword.",,,,,,,,,,,,Sugiarto et al. 1995:25; Steingass 1892:145; Hayyim 1934-36:206,General,,,

Echols and Shadily 1989 have two entries: kongko ‘talk, chat’ (marked Ch for ‘Chinese’) and kongkol ‘talking over something’.  It is conceivable that the second is derived from the first, despite the unusual addition of a final -l.  Stevens and Schmidgall-Tellings (2004:515) list kongko ‘to gossip, chat’ and markes it C J, meaning the word occurs in Chinese Indonesian and Jakarta Indonesian; they also list kongkol ‘intrigue, scheme, plot’, marked as D 
(indicating a Dutch origin).  They also list sekongkel, sekongkol (p. 892) ‘to plot, intrigue, conspire...’, also marked D.  Wilkinson (1959:609) lists kongkol as a Dutch loanword meaning ‘talking over anything’, and gives the source word as konkelen, and also lists sekongkol ‘dealing in stolen goods’ as deriving from the same Dutch word (1959:1039).  Kramer’s  comprehensive Dutch-English Dictionary has konkelen meaning ‘plot, intrigue, scheme’.  However the word kongkol/sekongkol does not appear in Grijns et al. 1983.  It is possible that konkelen was originally part of the vocabulary of Indonesian Dutch, which contained many local loanwords, some of which were passed into continental Dutch (i.e. the direction of borrowing would be reversed).  These words are all related to kongkalikong ‘plot, conspiracy, intrigue’, marked C in Stevens and Schmidgall-Tellings, and without any special dialect indication in Echols and Shadily 1989; it does not appear in Wilkinson 1959.  To add to the confusion, Javanese has sekongkel and kongkalikong, Balinese also has sekongkel and kongkalikong, and Sundanese sakongkol.","Leo 1975:5,33; Sugiarto et al. 1995:330; Robson and Wibisono 2002:661",General,,Present in pre-contact environment,
